 * Addison Chen
 * Assignment 4
 * ICSI 310
 * The challenge question is called Recursive power method. In which the goal of the program is to write a method
 * using recursion to raise a number to a power.  By accepting two argument the base and the exponent.  The question
 * only asking for only positive integers.
